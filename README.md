Welcome!

This README is designed to explain how one can use the classes developed to analyse neutrino flux data from long baseline experiments. Please note that this serves as merely a qualitative guide to using the program. For documentations regarding the member function and variables, please refer to the header (.h or .hpp) files.

INTRODUCTION & MOTIVATION
#########################
The set of classes are developed with two main objectives:

1) From long baseline experiments in the near future, the value for various PMNS parameters may be further constrained. This is done by minimising the log likelihood (LLH) between the measured neutrino (and antineutrino) flux and the fit based on current (August 2017) values of PMNS parameters. This is done iteratively using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

2) Based on previous simulations, there is a clear distinction between the neutrino and antineutrino flux values, indicating the possibility of CPT and Lorentz symmetry violation. We propose an additional parameter, beta, that feeds into oscillation probability in attempt to account for this asymmetry.
